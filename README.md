# orders_application

Angular application which displays orders, products and customers.
A user can:
- login/logout
- signup
- see all the orders, add an order, remove an order
- see all the customers, add a customer, remove a customer
- see all the products, add a product, remove a product
- see the different categories and the list of products in each category
- see a specific order by clicking on it in the list of orders
- see a specific customer by clicking on it in the list of customers

I needed a backend application and a database to deal with so I have used MONGO and a NodeJS application that I have installed locally, with an implementation made by me but that I won't provide here.
